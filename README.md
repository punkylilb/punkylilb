- 👋 Hi, I’m @punkylilb
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts, constantly curious and like to learn
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code properly, having fumbled my way through for the last 6 months or so.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on probably nothing just yet, but who knows what the future may hold.
- 📫 How to reach me ... we'll add this later
